# mathcamp-QQuiz-lean
Formalizations of problems from Canada/USA Mathcamp Qualifying Quizzes. Most of the Quizzes can be found [here](https://www.mathcamp.org/past_summers/quiz/), while the most recent quiz can be found [here](https://www.mathcamp.org/qualifying_quiz/current_quiz/).


If you've installed Lean and VSCode according to [these instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html#regular-install), then you should be able to view this project locally with 
`leanproject get jalex-stark/mathcamp-QQuiz-lean`.

We may eventually make these proofs readable from a web browser. One option is to use the [format_lean tool](https://github.com/leanprover-community/format_lean), whose output [looks like this](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html).
